# TradGames - Treasure Hunt

## About TradGames
Greetings! My name is Michael, and I am the CEO and project manager of TradGames Inc. Besides leading the team, I also contribute as a programmer and junior designer. Our team consists of five dedicated members, all under the age of 18, with myself being the eldest. We are committed to creating unique Catholic-themed games that have not been explored by other companies. Although we are new to the industry, we are passionate about our mission and would greatly appreciate any support, whether it be in the form of funds, assistance, or encouragement. While we do not have a website yet, you can reach out to me through my GitHub account if you are interested in our work.

## Early Days
As of now, we are beginning with a simple treasure hunt game to hone our skills. On Day 1, we have laid the groundwork and developed a Python script to scatter trees across the game environment. Although the script is still a work in progress, we are excited about the potential it holds. Here is a preview of our ![Python Tree Scattering Script](https://github.com/MiguelWJerome/TradGames-TreasureHunt/blob/main/README-images/ScatterScript.png?raw=true). Additionally, we have created a treasure chest filled with rubies, which you can view ![here](https://github.com/MiguelWJerome/TradGames-TreasureHunt/blob/main/README-images/TreasureChest.png?raw=true). While the final appearance of our forest is yet to be determined, we are aiming for a cartoony block style, similar to this ![example](https://github.com/MiguelWJerome/TradGames-TreasureHunt/blob/main/README-images/ExampleStyle.png?raw=true). As our skills improve, we plan to incorporate realistic textures and more diverse human characters into the game.

## Project Growth
In addition to TradGames, I am involved in several other projects. However, I encourage you to keep an eye on this repository to witness its growth and development. If you would like to support us in any way, please do not hesitate to message or email us. It is time for Christendom to make its mark in the gaming market. Even if we are a few decades late, we are ready to make a difference!

Thank you for your interest in TradGames Inc. We look forward to your support and collaboration.
